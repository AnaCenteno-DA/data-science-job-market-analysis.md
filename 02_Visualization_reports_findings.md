# Stories in Data

### 4.Visualizations
This stage is one of the most interesting, as it involves creating visualizations and analyzing the data. Various datasets will be presented to highlight KPI performance, parameter trends over time, and key statistics. These insights can provide valuable information to support decision-making within the company, helping to shape strategies or adjust plans aimed at improving processes or addressing areas of concern based on the findings. 

## Type of Visualizations

For this project the following type of charts were used: 
- Clustered bar charts
- Filled maps
- Line chart
- Donut chart
- Wordcloud
- Tables
- Card
- Slicers

  

On Visual Page 1, several visualizations are displayed on the dashboard. These provide dynamic, clear, and precise information using cards, slicers, and various charts, including donut, line, scatter, bar, and column charts.

### 5.Exploratory Findings 


Data Storytelling: Job Postings in the Data Science Field

The analysis reveals that the average maximum salary offered in the job postings reached $9.87K, while the lowest average salary was $7.29K. On average, each job posting received about 10 applicants, indicating a moderate level of competition per position.

From 2017 to 2021, there was a noticeable increase in the number of recruiting companies specializing in the Data Science field, reflecting the growing demand for professionals in this area.

In terms of company size, the majority of hires were made by large IT companies with 1,000 to 5,000 employees, accounting for 40.58% of the total. In contrast, smaller companies with 501 to 1,000 employees accounted for only 0.88%, showing a clear hiring preference toward larger organizations.

When examining job levels, the distribution is heavily skewed toward the Mid-Senior level, which makes up 90% of the postings. Meanwhile, Executive-level positions represent only 10%, highlighting that most opportunities are geared toward professionals with intermediate experience rather than top-level executives.

In conclusion, This analysis underscores the dynamic and evolving nature of the Data Science job market. With competitive salaries, a moderate number of applicants per role, and a clear demand from large IT firms, itâ€™s evident that the field continues to mature. The dominance of Mid-Senior level roles signals strong opportunities for professionals with solid experience, while the relatively low presence of executive positions points to a more limited path at the top tier. Overall, the data reflects a thriving industry that values experience and scale, with promising prospects for skilled data professionals.
