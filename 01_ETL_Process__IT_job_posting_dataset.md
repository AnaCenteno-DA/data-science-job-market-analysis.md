# ETL Process

## Etapes

The ETL process (Extract, Transform, Load) is fundamental in data management and consists of three main stages:

### 1. Extraction (Extract)

This stage involves obtaining data from one or more sources.<br>

**Goal**: Bring in raw data from its source to begin working with it.

- The sources for this project is a file in format CSV (Comma-Separated Values) and it will be loaded in Power BI.

### 2. Transformation (Transform)

This is where the data is cleaned, structured, and modified to make it useful and consistent.<br>

**Goal**: Ensure that the data is in a suitable format for analysis or final loading.

Some common tasks include in this stage are:

- Removing duplicates

- Correcting formatting errors

- Standardizing units or date formats

- Creating new columns or calculations

- Filtering out unnecessary data

- Combining multiple sources (joins)

### 3. Load 

Finally, the transformed data is loaded into its final destination.<br>

**Goal:** Make the data available for analysis, visualization, or operational use.

- In this case, the clean file will be loaded into a dashboard, such as Power BI.
