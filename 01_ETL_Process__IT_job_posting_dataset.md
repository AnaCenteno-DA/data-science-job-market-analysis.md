# ETL Process

## Etapes

The ETL process (Extract, Transform, Load) is fundamental in data management and consists of three main stages:

### 1. Extraction (Extract)

This stage involves obtaining data from one or more sources.<br>

**Goal**: Bring in raw data from its source to begin working with it.

- The sources for this project is a file in format CSV (Comma-Separated Values) and it will be loaded in Power BI.

### 2. Transformation (Transform)

This is where the data is cleaned, structured, and modified to make it useful and consistent.<br>

**Goal**: Ensure that the data is in a suitable format for analysis or final loading.

Some common tasks include in this stage are:

- Removing duplicates

- Correcting formatting errors

- Standardizing units or date formats

- Creating new columns or calculations

- Filtering out unnecessary data

- Combining multiple sources (joins)

### 3. Load 

Finally, the transformed data is loaded into its final destination.<br>

**Goal:** Make the data available for analysis, visualization, or operational use.

- In this case, the clean file will be loaded into a dashboard, such as Power BI.

For this part, the visualizations where elaborated with the loaded and cleaned dataset of the Job postings for the careers related to the domain for the Data Science.
