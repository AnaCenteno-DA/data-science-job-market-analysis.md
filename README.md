## 📝 Project Summary

This project was completed in collaboration with **MCIT-Data**, a recruiting firm focused on the data science industry. The goal was to explore a comprehensive dataset of job postings and uncover valuable trends in the job market over the span of five years. The dataset used for this project is fictitious but modeled to reflect realistic patterns and structures commonly found in industry job boards.

Through this analysis, we aimed to identify the most in-demand roles, required skills, salary expectations, and job types within the data science field. The results of this project are presented in a fully interactive dashboard built with **Power BI**.
